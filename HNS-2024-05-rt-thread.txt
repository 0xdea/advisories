--[ 1 - Summary

"Security is in the mind of the programmer and in the mind of the designer.
Not so much in the code." 
                                                             -- Alisa Esage

RT-Thread [1] is an open-source, community-based real-time operating system
(RTOS). RT-Thread can be used in sensing nodes, wireless connection chips,
and many other resource-constrained scenarios. It is also widely applied in
gateways, IPC, smart speakers, and other high-performance IoT applications.

We reviewed RT-Thread's source code hosted on GitHub [2] and identified
multiple security vulnerabilities that may cause memory corruption and
security feature bypass. Their impacts range from denial of service to
potential arbitrary code execution.

We also audited the lwIP [3] and TinyDir [4] codebases on which some
RT-Thread functionalities depend, and found some additional vulnerabilities
that were subsequently fixed by the respective maintainers.


--[ 2 - Background

After our recent vulnerability disclosures [5] in the IoT space, we decided
to keep assisting open-source projects in finding and fixing security
vulnerabilities by reviewing their source code. RT-Thread was selected as a
target of interest. Other RTOSes will be featured in future advisories and
writeups.

During this review, we made use of our Semgrep C/C++ ruleset [6] to
identify hotspots in code on which to focus our attention. We also took
advantage of this opportunity to improve and update the ruleset [7].


--[ 3 - Vulnerabilities

The vulnerabilities resulting from our source code review are briefly
described in the following sections.


--[ 3.1 - CVE-2024-24335 - Buffer overflow in RT-Thread dfs_v2 romfs filesystem

We spotted a buffer overflow vulnerability at the following location in the
RT-Thread dfs_v2 romfs filesystem source code:

* /components/dfs/dfs_v2/filesystems/romfs/dfs_romfs.c

Lack of length check in the `dfs_romfs_getdents()` function could lead to a
buffer overflow at the marked line:
```c
static int dfs_romfs_getdents(struct dfs_file *file, struct dirent *dirp, uint32_t count)
{
    rt_size_t index;
    const char *name;
    struct dirent *d;
    struct romfs_dirent *dirent, *sub_dirent;

    dirent = (struct romfs_dirent *)file->vnode->data;
    if (check_dirent(dirent) != 0)
    {
        return -EIO;
    }
    RT_ASSERT(dirent->type == ROMFS_DIRENT_DIR);

    /* enter directory */
    dirent = (struct romfs_dirent *)dirent->data;

    /* make integer count */
    count = (count / sizeof(struct dirent));
    if (count == 0)
    {
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    index = 0;
    for (index = 0; index < count && file->fpos < file->vnode->size; index++)
    {
        d = dirp + index;

        sub_dirent = &dirent[file->fpos];
        name = sub_dirent->name;

        /* fill dirent */
        if (sub_dirent->type == ROMFS_DIRENT_DIR)
            d->d_type = DT_DIR;
        else
            d->d_type = DT_REG;

        d->d_namlen = rt_strlen(name);
        d->d_reclen = (rt_uint16_t)sizeof(struct dirent);
        rt_strncpy(d->d_name, name, rt_strlen(name) + 1); /* VULN: buffer overflow if rt_strlen(name) is larger than sizeof(d->d_name) due to missing length check */

        /* move to next position */
        ++ file->fpos;
    }

    return index * sizeof(struct dirent);
}
```

Note: dfs_v1 romfs in /components/dfs/dfs_v1/filesystems/romfs/dfs_romfs.c
is not affected, because the string copy operation is implemented
differently:
```c
        len = rt_strlen(name);
        RT_ASSERT(len <= RT_UINT8_MAX);
        d->d_namlen = (rt_uint8_t)len;
        d->d_reclen = (rt_uint16_t)sizeof(struct dirent);
        rt_strncpy(d->d_name, name, DFS_PATH_MAX);
```

Even if the assertion is compiled-out in production code, `len` is not used
for the copy operation anyway. Therefore, unless `DFS_PATH_MAX` is larger
than `sizeof(d->d_name)`, this code should be safe.

--[ 3.3 - CVE-2024-25389 - Weak random source in RT-Thread rt_random driver

We noticed a weak random source at the following location in the RT-Thread
rt_random driver source code:

* /components/drivers/misc/rt_random.c

Weak random generator in the the `calc_random()` function:
```c
static rt_uint16_t calc_random(void)
{
    seed = 214013L * seed + 2531011L;
    return (seed >> 16) & 0x7FFF;   /* return bits 16~30 */

--[ 3.4 - CVE-2024-25388 - Heap buffer overflow in RT-Thread wlan driver

We spotted a heap buffer overflow vulnerability at the following location
in the RT-Thread wlan driver source code:

* /components/drivers/wlan/wlan_mgnt.c

Since `len` is a signed integer in the `rt_wlan_send_to_thread()` function,
a small negative value could lead to a buffer overflow at the marked lines:
```c
#ifdef RT_WLAN_WORK_THREAD_ENABLE
...
static rt_err_t rt_wlan_send_to_thread(rt_wlan_event_t event, void *buff, int len)
{
    struct rt_wlan_msg *msg;

    RT_WLAN_LOG_D("F:%s is run event:%d", __FUNCTION__, event);

    /* Event packing */
    msg = rt_malloc(sizeof(struct rt_wlan_msg) + len); /* VULN: if len is a small negative number, this would result in an under-allocation */
    if (msg == RT_NULL)
    {
        RT_WLAN_LOG_E("wlan mgnt send msg err! No memory");

        msg->buff = (void *)&msg[1];
        rt_memcpy(msg->buff, buff, len); /* VULN: the small negative number would become a large unsigned size, and we would have a wild memcpy and a heap buffer overflow */
        msg->len = len;

    /* send event to wlan thread */
    if (rt_wlan_workqueue_dowork(rt_wlan_mgnt_work, msg) != RT_EOK)

--[ 3.5 - CVE-2024-25390 - Heap buffer overflows in RT-Thread finsh

We spotted some heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities at the following
locations in the RT-Thread finsh source code:

* /components/finsh/msh_file.c
* /components/finsh/msh.c

Unbounded `rt_sprintf()` in the `directory_delete_for_msh()` function could
lead to a heap buffer overflow at the marked line:
```c

--[ 3.6 - CVE-2024-25391 - Stack buffer overflow in RT-Thread IPC

We spotted a stack buffer overflow vulnerability at the following location
in the RT-Thread IPC source code:

* /components/libc/posix/ipc/mqueue.c

Unbounded `rt_sprintf()` in the `mq_unlink()` function could lead to a
stack buffer overflow at the marked line:
```c
int mq_unlink(const char *name)
{
    if(*name == '/')
    {
        name++;
    }
    const char *mq_path = "/dev/mqueue/";

    rt_sprintf(mq_name, "%s%s", mq_path, name); /* VULN: stack buffer overflow */
    return unlink(mq_name);
}
```

Note: the mq_open() function in /components/libc/posix/ipc/mqueue.c
implements bound checking:
```c
    int len = rt_strlen(name);
    if (len > RT_NAME_MAX)
    {

These are not necessarily security concerns for RT-Thread. However, as a
general rule, it is important to keep dependencies as up to date as
possible, because more relevant bugs might get fixed upstream.

--[ 4 - Affected products

RT-Thread 5.0.2, TinyDir 1.2.5, lwIP 2.2.0, and (likely) earlier versions
are affected by the vulnerabilities discussed in this advisory.


--[ 5 - Remediation

RT-Thread developers have fixed some of the vulnerabilities discussed in
this advisory. However, some of the reported vulnerabilities are still
open.

Please check the official RT-Thread channels for further information about
fixes.


--[ 6 - Disclosure timeline

We reported the vulnerabilities discussed in this advisory to RT-Thread in
November 2023, by opening issues [8] on GitHub as directed [9] by the
maintainers.

Following our request, MITRE assigned CVE IDs to all vulnerabilities in
February 2024.

Even though not all vulnerabilities were fixed by the maintainers, we
decided to go ahead with public disclosure after about 90 days since the
initial reports. This decision was taken mainly based on the fact that the
vulnerability reports were already publicly accessible as GitHub issues.

The detailed coordinated disclosure timeline follows:

2023-11-12: Asked on GitHub how to report potential security issues.
2023-11-13: RT-Thread founder replied to open issues directly on GitHub.
2023-11-20: Opened the first issue on GitHub.
2023-11-24: First vulnerability fixed; reported some other vulnerabilities.
2023-11-28: Second (and third) vulnerability fixed.
2023-12-24: Asked maintainers for updates.
2024-01-17: Requested the first batch of CVE IDs from MITRE.
2024-01-26: Informed maintainers of plan to publish advisory in February.
2024-02-02: Requested the second batch of CVE IDs from MITRE.
2024-02-07: CVE IDs for all reported vulnerabilities assigned by MITRE.
2024-02-08: Communicated CVE IDs and new 2024-03-05 publication date.
2024-02-18: Maintainers acknowledge publication date and inform about new fixes.
2024-03-05: Published advisory and writeup.


--[ 7 - Acknowledgments

We would like to thank RT-Thread, lwIP, and TinyDir developers for the time
dedicated to triaging the reported vulnerabilities. We would also like to
thank MITRE for assigning CVE IDs upon our request.
