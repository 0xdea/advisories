--[ 1 - Summary

"This is the OG we all want to be, congrats on 20yrs of (public) vulns!"
                                                         -- Erik Cabetas

TinyDir is a lightweight, portable and easy to integrate C directory and
file reader. It wraps dirent for POSIX and FindFirstFile for Windows.

We reviewed TinyDir's source code hosted on GitHub [1] and identified some
security vulnerabilities that may cause memory corruption. Their impacts
range from denial of service to potential arbitrary code execution.


--[ 2 - Background

While auditing another codebase, we noticed that it included TinyDir.
Since this small but successful project is used in hundreds of repositories
[2], we decided to review it in search of security bugs.


--[ 3 - Vulnerabilities

We spotted some buffer overflow vulnerabilities with long path names in the
tinydir_file_open() function, at the marked locations in the following
source code listing:

```c
/* Open a single file given its path */
_TINYDIR_FUNC
int tinydir_file_open(tinydir_file *file, const _tinydir_char_t *path)
